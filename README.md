# NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day in Cordova
This is a basic Cordova application (Android only) using fetch that makes an API call to NASA's APOD (Astronomy Picture of the Day).

https://api.nasa.gov/

The layout uses Bootstrap 5.3.2. I decided not to create a HTML string with inserts but use JS createElement's etc.

I'm going to create a React version and create a project branch.

Make sure you have your environment set up. Then run
```
cordova platform add android
cordova run android
```

The plugins should get installed automatically.
